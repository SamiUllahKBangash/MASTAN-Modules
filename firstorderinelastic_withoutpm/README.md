As the name suggests, this module performs first order inelastic analysis using event to event plastic hinge procedure. Bilinear elastic-plastic stress strain response is assumed
with user-defined hardening parameter. Axial-Flexural plastic interaction is not accounted for i.e. (plasticity is only assumed on internal moments at element ends') Co-rotational
and Coordinate Transformations are used to obtain Global-Local Stiffness Matrices based on the work by Chen et al. Element State Determination is used to obtain successive Load
Scale Factors to jump to the next plastic hinge event(s).
