# MASTAN2-Modules
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for running Eigenvalue and Second Order Inelastic Analysis inspired from MASTAN2 Software. Lumped Plasticity Formulation has been implemented using Plastic Reduction Matrices while Green-Lagrange Strain definition has been utilized to implement geometric nonlinearity. In addition, Elastic and In-Elastic Eigenvalue Buckling modules have been provided for running Instability Analysis for 2D and 3D Frame Geometry.
