I am extremely thankful to Dr. Ricardo A. Herrera and Dr. Arif Masud for offering their Courses on Nonlinear Analysis at UIUC in Fall 2017. I am also indebted to Dr. Larry
Fahnestock for giving me the opportunity to work on an Independent Study of Eccentrically Braced Frames. Thank you from the core of my heart to the US Congress and Department of State's (ECA) for funding my Fulbright Masters Program and providing students from Pakistan an opportunity to study with the best minds.

Thank you Dr. Arun Prakash for providing an excellent educational resource at your personal website. Infact, your Matlab Code provided the backbone for my Nonlinear Scripts.
