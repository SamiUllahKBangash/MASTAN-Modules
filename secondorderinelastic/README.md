Runs Second Order Inelastic Analysis using lumped plasticity formulation. Geometric and Plastic Reduction Matrices are formulated in an Updated Lagrangian setting. Two incremental
nonlinear schemes are provided for load controlled analysis, namely: 
a) Single Step Euler
b) Midpoint Runge-Kutta 

Instructions: 
Geometry Input File 'example10point5.m' may be modified depending on Analyst's requirement.
Run 'Revised_euler.m' for Single Step Euler solver.
Run 'revised_rk2_verI.m' or 'revised_rk2_verII.m' for Midpoint Runge-Kutta solver
