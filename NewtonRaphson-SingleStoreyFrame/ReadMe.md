The script provided in this module runs a comparison analysis of three standard basic incremental schemes, namely:
a) Euler Single Step
b) Runge Kutta Midpoint
c) Newton Raphson (Standard/Modified versions)

Test Case chosen for this purpose is a single storey Steel Frame. Problem Definition details can be found in the .pdf supplied with this module. A simplified sdof version of Tangent
and Secant Stiffnesses are derived for the single storey frame and proportional loading applied until critical load. For further details on the algorithm, please see [1].

Dr. Ricardo Herrera guided the theory development and setup of the problem including Tangent and Secant Stiffness formation and State Determination process.
