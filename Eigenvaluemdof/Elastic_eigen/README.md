This Module contains scripts that handle both braced and unbraced 2-D frame geometries. For the Cubic Hermitian Elements, Power Method and Polynomial expansion techniques are 
employed to obtain eigenvalue solutions for ELASTIC buckling analysis. In addition, stability function approach is also provided for comparison.
