Runs First Order Inelastic Analysis using lumped plasticity formulation. Member End Node Axial Forces and Bending Moments are tracked along a normalized yield function criteria.
Plastic Reduction Matrix is used to create effective tangent stiffness for each load step. Geometric Nonlinearity is not accounted for and forces are expressed in the original 
reference (undeformed) configuration.
